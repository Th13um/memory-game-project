# Memory Game Project

This is the project nÂ°2 of the Google Udacity Front end nanodegree : The Memory Game.

_(This is the remake of my first repository that I have unintentionally erased by wanting to delete another.)_

## Project Goals

This is a simple memory game, like the card one we play when we are kids, but a little geeky.

The purpose was to show our understanding of manipulating the DOM, make responsive design and show what we learn so far.

## How to try the Game

-   Clone the repo (or download the zip file) and launch the index.html
-   Or play it on Codepen [here](https://codepen.io/Th13um/pen/RMErBQ)

### Rules

It's exactly the same rules as the memory card game:

-   You have 16 cards on the game board.
-   You can choose 2 cards each time.
-   If the cards match, they remain face up.
-   If the cards do not match, they come back face down.
-   To win, you must make the 8 pairs.
-   To make a better score, make less movement.
